## How to use

Not released yet, so if you want to use it you'll have to clone and `apm link` it.
Then make sure settings path to coverage.json points to your coverage.json file genereated by istanbul.

## Roadmap

- [ ] add unit tests
- [ ] release 0.1.0
- [ ] add support for branch coverage
- [ ] add support for function coverage
- [ ] mark hits (calls) in gutter
